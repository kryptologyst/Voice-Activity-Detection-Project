# Privacy & Ethics Disclaimer

## IMPORTANT: Research and Educational Use Only

This Voice Activity Detection (VAD) project is designed exclusively for **research and educational purposes**. It is not intended for production use or any commercial applications.

## Privacy Protection Measures

### Data Handling
- **No Data Storage**: Audio files are processed locally and are not stored or transmitted
- **Local Processing**: All analysis is performed on your local machine
